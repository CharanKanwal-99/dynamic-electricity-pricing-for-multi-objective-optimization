# dynamic-electricity-pricing-for-multi-objective-optimization
The project aims to set dynamic electricity pricing so as to perform bi-level and multi objective optimization. The prices are based on TLOU(Time and Level of Use) pricing mechnaism wherein different prices are set for different hours of the day and at each hour, there is a fixed threshold consumption above which leads to different charges than consumption below it. The prices are set to maximise retailer profit, minimize emissions and minimize customer consumption cost. Maximizing profit and minimizing emissions by retailer is defined as the leader's problem while minimization of consumer's cost is defined as the follower's problem in this bi-level optimization scenario. Gurobi Mixed Integer Programming Solver is used to solve the optimization problem.
