# dynamic-electricity-pricing-for-multi-objective-optimization
The project aims to set dynamic electricity pricing so as to perform bi-level and multi objective optimization. The prices are set to maximise retailer profit, minimize emissions and minimize customer consumption cost. Maximizing profit and minimizing emissions by retailer are defined as the leader's problem while minimization of consumer's cost is defined as the follower's problem in this bi-level optimization scenario. Gurobi Mixed Integer Programming Solver is used to solve the optimization problem.
